    <p>
While the quick <c>GitHub.dev</c> interface is great
for quick edits, many projects require the ability
to run applications and execute code as you would on
your personal computer. Fortunately, GitHub offers a
service to run such programs on their servers.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-codespaces">
      <statement>
        <p>
A <term>Codespace</term> is a <q>dev environment</q> service
<url href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">offered by GitHub</url>.
Each codespace is essentially a personal virtual computer that
runs in the cloud, that you access through your web browser.
        </p>
        <p>
Full documentation on Codespaces is available on
<url href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces">docs.github.com</url>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <note xml:id="note-create-codespace">
      <p>
To create a Codespace on any repository you own, use the green
<q>Code</q> button, select the Codespaces tab, and press
the green <q>Create codespace on [branchname]</q> button.
      </p>
    </note>
    <p>
After the Codespace boots up, you'll have an interface similar
to the <c>GitHub.dev</c> environment you learned about in
<xref ref="sec-using-github-dev"/>.
    </p>
    <note xml:id="dev-codespace-contrast">
      <p>
Here are a few key differences between
<c>GitHub.dev</c> and Codespaces.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
A <c>GitHub.dev</c> URL looks like <c>github.dev/username/reponame</c>,
while a Codespace URL looks like
<c>random-word-123randomcharacters789.github.dev</c>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
<c>GitHub.dev</c> is quicker to load than a Codespace.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
<c>GitHub.dev</c> has a much more limited selection of VS Code
extensions to use.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
You can only install applications and execute code on a Codespace.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </note>
    <p>
One similarity between <c>GitHub.dev</c> and Codespaces
(besides the obviously similar VS Code user interfaces),
is that your work is still private to you and can only be
shared with the public (and retained in the long term) by
committing and pushing your progress every so often to your
<c>GitHub.com</c> repository. The Source Control tool works slightly
different in a Codespace, however.
    </p>
    <note xml:id="note-commit-sync">
      <p>
One quick way to commit and push your changes from a Codespace
is to use <q>Source Control</q> from the left toolbar.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
Enter a short commit message describing
your changes as a note to yourself. (This is
required and can be a pain to fix if you forget
to do so!)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
Select <q>Commit &amp; Sync</q> from the menu
next to the green Commit button.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
In the dialogs that follow, I suggest choosing
to <q>Always</q> stage all your changes and commit them
directly, then <q>OK, Don't Show Again</q> when told
this action will pull and push commits from and to
<c>origin/main</c>, and finally <q>Yes</q> that you
would like your Codespace to periodically run
<c>git fetch</c>.

  <section xml:id="sec-jupyter-notebooks">
    <title>Python and Jupyter Notebooks</title>
    <p>
<url href="https://python.org">Python</url> is an
popular open-source all-purpose programming language, and
a convenient way to write, execute, and share the
results of Python code is a
<url href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</url>.
    </p>
    <p>
To get started, create a Codespace
(<xref ref="note-create-codespace"/>)
on either an existing or new repository
(<xref ref="sec-creating-the-repo"/>).
You can then create a Jupyter notebook file named
<c>notebook.ipynb</c>.
    </p>
    <note xml:id="note-provision-notebook">
      <p>
In a Codespace, any file with the extension <c>*.ipynb</c>
(short for <q><em>IPY</em>thon <em>N</em>ote<em>B</em>ook</q>,
Jupyter's original name)
will be treated as a
Jupyter notebook. When opening this file, you'll see a notebook
interface, and be prompted to
<q>install the recommended 'Python' extension</q> if it's
not already enabled - do this.
      </p>
      <p>
Then in your notebook file, click the <q>Select Kernel</q>
button, then <q>Install/Enable suggested extensions</q> for
Python+Jupyter. You should then have the option to select
a <q>Python environment</q> such as <c>Python 3.*.*</c>.
      </p>
      <p>
If successful, you should be able to enter
<c>import sys; print(sys.version)</c> into the displayed
text box,
and see the result of executing it with
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
      </p>
    </note>
    <p>
There are plenty of existing tutorials on the internet to help you
get acquainted with Python and Jupyter now that you have them
available to you in your Codespace. But to get you started, I've provided
one <dataurl source="sample-notebook.ipynb">sample notebook</dataurl>
that you can upload to your Codespace to break the ice.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="sec-github-pages-codespace">
    <title>Previewing GitHub Pages</title>
    <p>
Another useful application of Codespaces is the ability
to preview your GitHub Pages site created in
<xref ref="sec-using-a-template"/>. Return to that repository
on <c>GitHub.com</c> and create a new Codespace
(<xref ref="note-create-codespace"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
To spin up your live preview, open a terminal by using the
<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> keys. To make
sure the necessary software has been installed, type <c>bundle</c>
and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Then, you can enter <c>jekyll serve</c>
to start the preview server.
    </p>
    <p>
You'll see some output, and eventually
<c>Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000</c>. At that time an
alert will appear that says <q>Your application on port 4000
is available</q>. You can use its <q>Open in browser</q> button,
or hover over the <c>http://127.0.0.1:4000</c> link to be given
the same option.
    </p>
    <p>
This should open a URL such as
<c>random-words-123randomletters789-4000.app.github.dev</c>,
which will show a live preview of your GitHub Pages site in a new
tab. As soon as you make edits in your Codespace tab, you can
return to this tab to (within a second or two) see how your edits
will update your live site. Note that this URL is private to you,
and your public site won't be updated until you Commit &amp; Sync
your changes
(<xref ref="note-commit-sync"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
Personally, I use <c>GitHub.dev</c> (or even just the
<c>GitHub.com</c> edit button) rather than a full
Codespace when adding a quick post or making a quick edit on
many of my GitHub Pages websites. But the Codespace option is very
handy for when bigger changes are necessary, and you want to make
sure everything looks just right before pushing it live to the public.
    </p>

  <section xml:id="sec-codespace-management">
    <title>Managing Your Codespaces</title>
    <p>
GitHub users are provided with a limited amount of free Codespace
hours and storage each month, with additional resources available
to Pro users, including those with the free GitHub Education
benefit (<xref ref="github-education-discount"/>). If needed,
there is the option to pay for additional resources.
    </p>
    <p>
As a mathematician
who almost exclusively uses GitHub Codespaces for doing the kinds
of work described in this handbook,
I've found that I often approach the quota provided
for Pro users, but have
not yet exceeded it. I accomplish this by being sure to not run
my Codespaces when I'm not actively working on them.
    </p>
    <note xml:id="note-manage-codespaces">
      <p>
To manage your Codespace resources, visit
<url href="https://github.com/codespaces"/>.
You can stop a Codespace temporarily to preserve your hourly quota,
and delete a Codespace you don't plan to use for a while to save
on your storage quota. While actively working in a Codespace,
you can stop it by pressing
<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>,
typing <c>stop current codespace</c>, and confirming.
      </p>
      <p>
In any case, a
stopped Codespace can be restarted later when you want to
resume work, even if you haven't committed and pushed your changes.
(But be warned: a stopped Codespace and its uncommitted changes may
be deleted by GitHub after a few days of inactivity, so don't leave it
alone for long.)
      </p>
      <p>
A deleted Codespace can always be recreated later based upon your most
recent commit.
      </p>
    </note>
<p>Putting it all together, we have seen three ways to access files on your repo.
  Going from the least easy to edit to the most editable we have: <c>GitHub.com</c>, <c>GitHub.dev</c>, <c>random-codespace-string.github.dev</c>. Here is what these environments look like.</p>
